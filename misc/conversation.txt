History
Wren Kitchens was founded in 2009. The management team behind Wren traded for 10 years in the
United States before the business was sold and the team moved back to the United Kingdom.

The company employs over 4,000 people and is one of the largest employers in the Humber region,
and was in 2019 named Retail Employer of the Year by jobs website Indeed. In 2016,
the firm reported record turnover growth as sales surged past £338 million.
This also grew in 2017, with reported revenue of £406 million.

In 2019, Wren reported a new record turnover of £490.1 million for the financial
year ending 31 December 2018, an increase of 20.7%,
and a pre-tax profit of £37.1 million, up 124% year-on-year.
The company said it believed there was a significant opportunity for
further growth in the UK and beyond.

Manufacturing
Until December 2013, the headquarters were in Howden, in the East Riding of Yorkshire,
United Kingdom, where it still operates a factory.
Wren manufactures all of its kitchen units in its own production plants in Scunthorpe,
Howden and Barton-upon-Humber.

The 180 acre Barton-upon-Humber site was acquired in August 2013 from Kimberly-Clark.
In January 2019, Wren Kitchens signed up for a 150,000 sq ft warehouse at the Humber Enterprise Park, near Hull.

Wren has been awarded FIRA International Gold Certification by The Furniture Industry Research Association,
the recognised quality mark for products or installation services within the furniture and kitchen industries.
It has received the award for its products in 2014 and for its installation standards in 2017.
In 2018, Wren introduced the world’s first 3D online kitchen planner for its customers,
making it easier for them to choose colours and units.

Wren information advisor Ryan Beecham, who raps in his spare time under the name CiVil,
 became an unwitting YouTube star when his kitchen-based rap
 ‘The Wren Difference’ was turned into an online advert,
 which has been viewed more than 1.5m times and attracted national media coverage.

In 2019, Wren was awarded the Made In Britain marque.
Made In Britain brings together the best manufacturers in the UK,
through the use of its registered collective mark, guaranteeing that members’
products are made in Britain and comply to the highest standards.

In 2019, The British Furniture Manufacturers (BFM), a trade association that
represents the interests of the British furniture industry, welcomed Wren
Kitchens into the association as an ‘Approved Member’.

Wren offered to find jobs for up to 280 staff at Kingstown Furniture in Hull,
which closed its doors in March 2019.
By June 2019, over 40 former Kingstown Furniture staff had secured positions with Wren.
It plans to open up to 18 new showrooms during the year and is currently delivering
manufacturing more than 2,000 kitchens a week at its three production sites.

In June 2019, Wren announced plans for a £120 million expansion of its manufacturing
headquarters in Barton-upon-Humber, North Lincolnshire, almost doubling manufacturing
output to keep up with growing consumer demand. Wren is seeking planning permission
for a new 910,000 sq. ft. facility, which to be built behind the existing Wren factory
on part of its 180-acre site, which has been earmarked for further development.
The new factory will create up to 1,200 new manufacturing jobs with additional roles
in engineering, IT, customer service and product development.
The project, once completed, will be the single largest investment in the company’s history.

********************************************************************************

Controversy
In 2015, Wren Kitchens was investigated by BBC Watchdog for providing customers
with poor customer service.
The investigation found that the company had provided partial orders to
customers and was extremely slow to rectify issues.
The firm responded by stating that they are heavily investing in
improving their customer service department.

In Spring 2016, the firm was one of 12 kitchen brands researched by the consumer
association Which?.
WrenLiving came second from last out of the 12 kitchen companies assessed.

In March 2016 the firm was fined £12,000 after pleading
guilty to breaking the Unfair Trading Regulations 2008,
Regulation 9 and the European Communities Act 1972 Section 2(2), by misleading
customers on kitchen pricing.

********************************************************************************
********************************************************************************
********************************************************************************

Charity work and community
In March 2014, Wren Kitchens donated £437,080 to charities supporting victims
of the 2013-14 United Kingdom winter floods.
The firm has also raised money for children's cancer charity CLIC Sargent
and Macmillan Cancer Support.

Wren Kitchens said it would "match all B&Q quotes" for customers
and had "opened vacancies" to the 400 design consultants whose jobs were at
risk at competitor B&Q following a restructure.

John Leggott College
Technology for Learning Developer / Software Developer
Company Name: John Leggott College
Dates Employed: Mar 2009 – Nov 2010
Employment Duration: 1 yr 9 mos
Location: Scunthorpe
Key achievements:

Migrated the college's Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) from Blackboard to
Moodle including setting up Moodle server, configuring for Single Sign On (SSO)
using NTLM and LDAP with the College's established Active Directory setup.
Setting up courses, migrating existing course material, training teachers and
support staff to use the new system and encouraged a community/social approach
to encourage use within the new system. The migration was an overwhelming success,
with more than double the use amongst students than the previous established VLE.

Setup a video encoding server to aid with compatibility and efficiency with
delivering multimedia content to students optimised for mobile devices, yet
simple for teachers to upload new videos in any format.

Migrated the college website over from its previous unmaintainable ASP setup,
to a more accessible CMS system using Joomla. The new design was implemented to
a branding guide that the college had recently introduced and provided a great
new look and feel for the college while enabling support staff to easily update
their particular sections of the website. The website has since had a few tweeks
to navigation but is largely still the same.

Delivered several guest-talks, presentations and demos at regional user
group forums including IT Managers (Higher Ed), TFL groups and Moodle User Groups.
These included topics such as Green IT, change management and media delivery.

RTK Instruments Ltd
Software Developer
Company Name: RTK Instruments Ltd
Dates Employed: Jul 2005 – Mar 2009
Employment Duration: 3 yrs 9 mos
Location: Knaresborough
As the sole computer software developer at RTK Instruments, I established a
development environment with the company and was involved in new software products
throughout the whole product lifecycle including specification, design, development,
implementation, packaging and support. I was also responsible for implementing
3rd-party bespoke SCADA-based alarm management systems for clients.

One key client SCADA based installation project, for which I designed the
monitoring system, was a £400k project for a petro-chemical site involving
Dual-redundant servers, retrieving alarm events from 7 sets of dual-redundant
PLCs for display/control by 7 multiple-redundent control room computers with no
single point of failure.

The two key software products I developed from start to finish were:

Alarm Management System client-server based system developed in Python using
 wxWidgets GUI toolkit and MySQL database displaying/organising critical/warning/info
 alarms with millisecond timestamp resolution collected from RS485 network of PLC units.

The other key system was a visual configuration tool to allow fine-grained settings
on various proprietary PLC units. Developed in Python using tkinter GUI toolkit and
communicated with the PLC via serial communication over USB (serial port emulator).
The configuration tool proved so intuitive and user focussed that it evolved to
include other related tools including Sales Quotation, Production step-by-step guides
(PCB components, jumper settings etc) and diagnostics.
